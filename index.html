			<h1>Don't you see how great this is?</h1>
			<p>You, you are a&hellip; <span class="names">Jesse</span> look at me. You&hellip; are a blowfish. A blowfish! Think about it. Small in stature, not swift, not cunning. Easy prey for predators but the blowfish has a secret weapon doesn't he. Doesn't he? What does the blowfish do, Jesse. What does the blowfish do? The blowfish puffs up, okay?</p>

			<h2>The blowfish puffs himself up four, five times larger than normal and why?</h2>
			<p>Why does he do that? So that it makes him intimidating, that's why. Intimidating! So that the other, scarier fish are scared off. And that's you! You are a blowfish. You see it's just all an illusion. You see it's&hellip; it's nothing but air. Now&hellip; who messes with the blowfish, <span class="names">Jesse</span>? You're damn right. You are a blowfish. Say it again. Say it like you mean it. You're a <em><strong>BLOWFISH</strong></em>!</p>

				<h3>My partner was about to get himself shot.</h3>
				<p>I intervened. He was angry because those two dealers of yours had just murdered an eleven-year-old boy. Then again, maybe he thought it was you who gave the order.<p>

				<h4>Look&hellip; I feel like I'm running out of ways to explain this to you but once more, I shall try.</h4>
				<p>This fly is a major problem for us. It will ruin our batch. And we need to destroy it and every trace of it, so we can cook. Failing that, we're dead. There's no more room for error. Not with these people.</p>

				<h5>You asked me if we were in the meth business or the money business.</h6> 
				<ul>
					<li>Neither, I'm in the empire business.</li>
					<li>I was under the impression that you had this under control.</li>
					<li>Well, that's what this is&mdash;problem solving.</li>

				<h6>He has enough money to last forever.</h5>
				<p>He knows he needs to keep moving. You'll never find him. He's out of the picture. I saved his life, I owed him that, but now he and I are done. Which is exactly what you wanted, isn't it. You've always struck me as a very pragmatic man so if I may, I would like to review options with you. Of which, it seems to me you have two.</p> 

				<ol>
					<li>Option A, you kill me right here and now. Apparently I've made that very easy for you. You can kill me, no witnesses and then spend the next few weeks or months tracking down Jesse Pinkman and you kill him too. A pointless exercise it seems to me but that is Option A.</li>
					<li>I continue cooking, you and I both forget about <span class="names">Pinkman</span>. We forget this ever happened. We consider this a lone hiccup in an otherwise long and fruitful business arrangement. I prefer Option B.</li>
